Background\n","In this assignment, we will explore the application of logistic regression to a binary classification problem in the field of medical diagnostics. The objective is to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass.\n","\n","The dataset used is the Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, incorporated into scikit-learn as `load_breast_cancer`. This dataset includes measurements from 569 instances of breast tumors, with each instance described by 30 numeric attributes. These features include things like the texture, perimeter, smoothness, and symmetry of the tumor cells.\n","\n","You will split the data into training and test sets, with 80% of the data used for training and the remaining 20% for testing. This setup tests the model’s ability to generalize to new, unseen data. We set the `random_state` as 42 to ensure reproducibility. The logistic regression model, initialized with the 'liblinear' solver, will be trained on the training set.\n","\n","Your tasks include training the model, predicting tumor classifications on the test set, and then calculating the accuracy of these predictions. You will calculate the accuracy both manually and using scikit-learn’s built-in `accuracy_score` function, and then verify if both methods yield the same result.\n","\n","The primary goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with logistic regression in a practical, real-world setting, and to understand the general machine learning workflows.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yZCUDuPbVnAj"},"source":["# 2.
